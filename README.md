# Folded-Image

This is a HTML document with embedded CSS and JavaScript code. The document defines a page with a container div that contains a UL element, which contains three LI elements. The page has a background color of #141731 and the container div has a height of 500px and a width of 600px. The UL element has absolute positioning and is skewed and rotated, giving the appearance of the LI elements being slanted. The LI elements are each 200px wide and 400px tall, with the odd ones slanted to the left and the even ones slanted to the right. The LI elements have a background image of a page and are arranged to appear like a book.

There is a text "Stinger Akali" at the bottom of the page that is initially hidden, but is revealed when the UL element is clicked. Additionally, there is a shadow element that appears behind the UL element when it is clicked.

There is also a script element that listens for a click event on the UL element and toggles the "active" class on it, as well as the "hide" class on the shadow element, causing them to change appearance.
